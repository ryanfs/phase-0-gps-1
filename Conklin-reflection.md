##Heather Conklin's reflection on GPS 1.1 Version Control

**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I think the main thing I've been struggling with in terms of git (and pretty much everything else we've covered so far) is the sense that I'm only seeing the tip of the iceberg. I feel good about understanding the things I've done up to this point but I bet there are a *lot* more to everything that I haven't seen yet. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
It was good to use the collaboration feature on GitHub and see how that works. Ryan (my pair on this challenge) also had more experience using git and GitHub so I asked him some questions about things I had read about, like .gitignore.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I asked for more information about collaborating and using GitHub with teams.

**What still confuses you about git?**
I can't think of anything that confuses me...at the moment. I'm sure there will be more confusion in my future.

I had an experience on another challenge that helped me figure out the (lack of) relationship between separate repos. Specifically: even though they all live in the same directory on my local and appear to live side-by-side on GitHub, I couldn't reference an image in my week-2/imgs folder while I was working on my website index page but had to put the image I wanted into the imgs folder in my heath3conk.github.io directory. Seems obvious now but wasn't when I tried to do it the other way. So that's really about GitHub and not git, I guess. 

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
My *first* experience was very stressful! I had some technical issues with Google Hangouts and couldn't hear either the guide or the other student. They were both very forgiving and we rescheduled to the following day, at which time I got my system working better. My *second* experience was therefore much better. We did run out of time before we got through the whole challenge so I definitely need to be more aware of the passage of time during my next session.
